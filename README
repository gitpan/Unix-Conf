Unix/Conf version 0.1
======================
The Unix::Conf module consists of small classes intended to be
used by the other modules in the Unix::Conf suite. The two
modules in Unix::Conf are Unix::Conf::Err and Unix::Conf::ConfIO.
The first is used to create Err objects which are returned back
to signal error. These objects store the state of the stack
at the time of creation and can be used to debug. The reason,
Unix::Conf::Err exists is because I don't particularly like 
general purpose libraries die'ing. Unix::Conf::ConfIO is a 
class for handling file I/O especially for configuration files.
It takes care of locking and security.

INSTALLATION
